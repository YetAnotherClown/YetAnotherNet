# Squash

[Squash](https://github.com/Data-Oriented-House/Squash) is a comprehensive SerDes library
which provides more extensive compression and control over the Buffer Compression of your data than
the internal SerDes library within YetAnotherNet.

## Why Also Use Squash

Why should you also use Squash when YetAnotherNet already has a SerDes library internally?
Good Question.

YetAnotherNet's SerDes library is completely dynamic, outputting a buffer with a format that can be read without any context.
With Squash, you can explicitly define the data you send and compress it without the overhead of the Internal SerDes Library's dynamic nature.

Here are some comparisons between the two from feeding them the same example data:

| Data   	| YetAnotherNet (bytes) 	| Squash (bytes) 	|
|--------	|-----------------------	|----------------	|
| Array  	| 45                    	| 37             	|
| Map    	| 66                    	| 40             	|
| Record 	| 283                   	| 89             	|
| Tuple  	| 88                    	| 31             	|

    <summary>See Data used for comparisons</summary>

    #### Array

    ```lua
        local array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5.5, 6.6, -7.7, -8.9, 10.01}
    ```

    #### Map

    ```lua
        local map = {
            [Vector2.new(1, 2)] = Vector3.new(1, 2, 3),
            [Vector2.new(4, 29)] = Vector3.new(4, 29, 33),
            [Vector2.new(72, 483)] = Vector3.new(72, 483, 555),
        }
    ```

    #### Record

    ```lua
        local record = {
            position = Vector2.new(287.3855, -13486.3),
            health = 9,
            name = "Cedrick",
            poisoned = true,
            items = {
                { name = 'Lantern', count = 2 },
                { name = 'Waterskin', count = 1 },
                { name = 'Map', count = 4 },
            },
            inns = {
                ['The Copper Cauldron'] = true,
                Infirmary = true,
                ['His Recess'] = true,
            }
        }
    ```

    #### Tuple

    ```lua
        local a, b, c, d = Vector3.new(123456789, 1, 0), CFrame.new(1, 2, 3), BrickColor.new(93), Enum.HumanoidStateType.Freefall
    ```

</details>

These comparisons show the scale of the tradeoff YetAnotherNet took for Dynamic compression, not to mention Squash is very well made.
YetAnotherNet primarily relies on Roblox's built-in compression of Buffers when sending over the network, so it isn't as bad as it seems.

Luckily, you can use Squash with YetAnotherNet without any large overhead as it accepts buffers as valid types to send over the network!

## How To Luau

```lua
local Squash = require("@packages/Squash")
local YetAnotherNet = require("@packages/YetAnotherNet")

local Route = YetAnotherNet.Route
type Route<U...> = YetAnotherNet.Route<U...>

local route: Route<number, string, boolean> = Route.new({})

local tuple = Squash.tuple(
    Squash.T(Squash.number(8)),
    Squash.T(Squash.string()),
    Squash.T(Squash.boolean())
)

-- Decompress
route:addIncomingMiddleware(function(_buffer: unknown)
	if type(_buffer) ~= "buffer" then
		return nil -- Drop packet on failed type validation
	end

	local cursor = Squash.frombuffer(_buffer)
	return tuple.des(cursor)
end)

-- Compress
route:addOutgoingMiddleware(function(number, string, boolean)
	local cursor = Squash.cursor()
	tuple.ser(cursor, number, string, boolean)

	return Squash.tobuffer(cursor)
end)

return {
	route = route,
}
```

## How To Typescript

You can find the TypeScript Types for Squash on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/squash).

```ts
import Squash from "@rbxts/squash";
import Route from "@rbxts/yetanothernet";

const route: Route<[number, boolean, string]> = new Route({
    Channel: "Reliable",
    Event: undefined,
});

const tuple = Squash.tuple(
    Squash.T(Squash.number(8)),
    Squash.T(Squash.string()),
    Squash.T(Squash.boolean())
);

// Decompress
route.addIncomingMiddleware(function (_buffer) {
    if (!typeIs(_buffer, "buffer")) {
        return undefined; // Drop packet on failed type validation
    }

	const cursor = Squash.frombuffer(_buffer);
	return tuple.des(cursor);
});

// Compress
route.addOutgoingMiddleware(function (number, string, boolean) {
	const cursor = Squash.cursor();
	tuple.ser(cursor, number, string, boolean);

	return $tuple(Squash.tobuffer(cursor));
});

export = {
	route: route,
};
```
