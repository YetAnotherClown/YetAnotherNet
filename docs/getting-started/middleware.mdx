# Middleware

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="lua" label="Luau" default>

Middleware is a powerful feature of YetAnotherNet that allows you to validate types before they are processed when sending and receiving data.

To create Middleware, you can specify a function in either `Route:addIncomingMiddleware()` or `Route:addOutgoingMiddleware()`.

```lua
local YetAnotherNet = require("@packages/YetAnotherNet")

local Route = YetAnotherNet.Route
type Route<U...> = YetAnotherNet.Route<U...>;

local route: Route<number, string, boolean> = Route.new()

-- Sets a function to be ran on Incoming packets before they are received over the network
route:addIncomingMiddleware(function(number: unknown, string: unknown, boolean: unknown)
    -- Do something, e.g., Validate Types

    return number, string, boolean
end)

-- Sets a function to be ran on Outgoing packets before they are sent over the network
route:addOutgoingMiddleware(function(number: number, string: string, boolean: boolean)
    -- Do something

    return number, string, boolean
end)
```

To validate your types, you can return the values in order to allow it to be processed, or you can drop the packet by returning `nil`. Dropped packets will never reach your code, meaning you can ensure that the types your code receives are always the types you expect.
