# Introduction

## What is this?

Net is a networking library for Roblox, or rather its a library that wraps around Roblox's RemoteEvents to solve certain issues and provide new API for networking on Roblox.

Some of the issues this library solves are:
- Overhead from RemoteEvents
- Ordering of Networking Events
- Lack of Type-Checking and Intellisense for working with RemoteEvents

Net also provides several utilities:
- Middleware
- Strict Type-Checking & Auto-completion
- Simple integration with Hooks
- Data-driven Design

You can learn more about how Net works and how to use it by visiting [Getting Started with Routes](/docs/getting-started/routes). Or, you can keep reading to learn more about the technical details and design choices that went into creating Net.

## Data-driven by design

One thing that separates Net from other networking libraries on Roblox is this key design choice. Net was made to work with ECS, a Data-driven approach to game design, which has influenced the design of the library largely and makes it unique from the rest.

With inspiration from [Bevy_Renet](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet/tree/master/bevy_renet), a Networking crate for use with the Bevy ECS in Rust, and another networking library on Roblox, [BridgeNet2](https://ffrostflame.github.io/BridgeNet2/), Net pushes to provide similar functionality to these two libraries for ECS on Roblox.

### Why go for Data-driven?

Data-driven design opposes Event-driven design, which is what you can commonly see on Roblox, such as RemoteEvents themselves. Event-driven design has it's woes, which is why we opt for ECS and generally Data-driven design.

Event-driven design is sensitive to ordering, this makes it difficult to know when you might get data from an event. To solve this, Net does not use Events, it encourages you to query and send data in an ordered manner frame-by-frame, preferably with ECS.

Since it's encouraged to use ECS with Net, though not required, we suggest reading [Matter â€” Why ECS?](https://matter-ecs.github.io/matter/docs/WhyECS) by Evaera.

## Installation

### Wally

```toml
[dependencies]
Net = "yetanotherclown/yetanothernet@0.7.0"
```

Note: Wally does not export types automatically, if you wish to use Strict Typing with Net, install [Wally Package Types](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/wally-package-types) with Aftman.

### Roblox Typescript

You can find Net as [YetAnotherNet on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/yetanothernet).

```json
"@rbxts/yetanothernet": "0.7.0-beta.2"
```
