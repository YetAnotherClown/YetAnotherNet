# ECR

### 🏗️ This page is under construction.

We're still learning the best practices for integrating and using YetAnotherNet with ECR, for now see [Other Setups](/docs/setup/other.mdx) for integrating YetAnotherNet into other game architectures that don't use Matter. You can also see the [Matter Setup](/docs/setup/matter.mdx) to see how you would setup and use YetAnotherNet for another ECS library.

You can also checkout [ECR — A Luau ECS library](https://github.com/centau/ecr).
