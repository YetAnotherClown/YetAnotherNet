Tracking issue [#20](https://github.com/YetAnotherClown/YetAnotherNet/issues/20)

We're still learning the best practices for integrating and using YetAnotherNet with jecs, for now see [Other Setups](/docs/setup/other.mdx) for integrating YetAnotherNet into other game architectures that don't use Matter. You can also see the [Matter Setup](/docs/setup/matter.mdx) to see how you would setup and use YetAnotherNet for another ECS library.

Checkout the [jecs repository](https://github.com/Ukendio/jecs) for information on the jecs ECS.
