<TabItem value="lua" label="Luau" default>

You can integrate Net into whatever game architecture you want by creating a Hook using ``Net.createHook({ Route })`` which is identical to the ``Net.start(loop, { Route })`` function. This function will return another function which you can call whenever you want to process your Routes' queues and send/receive your Packets on the Server or Client.

Below is a simple example of creating custom scheduling behavior using ``Net.createHook({ Route })``,
```lua
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local Net = require("Net.luau")
local routes = require("routes.luau")

local hook = Net.createHook(routes)
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(hook)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

You can integrate Net into whatever game architecture you want by creating a Hook using ``Net.createHook([Route])`` which is identical to the ``Net.start(loop, [Route])`` function. This function will return another function which you can call whenever you want to process your Routes' queues and send/receive your Packets on the Server or Client.

Below is a simple example of creating custom scheduling behavior using ``Net.createHook([Route])``,
```ts
import Net from "@rbxts/yetanothernet";
import routes from "shared/routes";

const RunService = game.GetService("RunService");

const hook = Net.createHook(routes);
RunService.Heartbeat.Connect(hook);
```
