You can integrate YetAnotherNet into whatever game architecture you want by creating a Hook using ``YetAnotherNet.createHook({ Route })`` which is identical to the ``YetAnotherNet.start(loop, { Route })`` function. This function will return another function which you can call whenever you want to process your Routes' queues and send/receive your Packets on the Server or Client.

Below is a simple example of creating custom scheduling behavior using ``YetAnotherNet.createHook({ Route })``,
```lua
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local YetAnotherNet = require("@packages/YetAnotherNet")
local routes = require("@shared/routes")

local myRoute = routes.myRoute

local beginFrame, endFrame = YetAnotherNet.createHook({ Route })
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function()
	beginFrame()

	myRoute:send(...)
	for i, player, data in myRoute:query() do
		-- Do something
	end

	endFrame()
end)
```
