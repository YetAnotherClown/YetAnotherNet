You can integrate YetAnotherNet into whatever game architecture you want by creating a Hook using ``YetAnotherNet.createHook({ Route })`` which is identical to the ``YetAnotherNet.start(loop, { Route })`` function. This function will return another function which you can call whenever you want to process your Routes' queues and send/receive your Packets on the Server or Client.

Below is a simple example of creating custom scheduling behavior using ``YetAnotherNet.createHook({ Route })``,
```lua
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local YetAnotherNet = require("@packages/YetAnotherNet")
local routes = require("@shared/routes")

local hook = YetAnotherNet.createHook(routes)
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(hook)
```
