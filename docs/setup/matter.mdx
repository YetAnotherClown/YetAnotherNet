# Matter

:::tip
Check out the adapted version of the Matter Example game to see how it's used in a real game.

See all of YetAnotherNet's [example projects](https://github.com/YetAnotherClown/YetAnotherNet/tree/main/examples) in the repository.

Being initially made for the Matter ECS, YetAnotherNet provides a simple function for scheduling your Routes to run on your Matter Loop.

Firstly, create a ``routes.luau`` ModuleScript in ReplicatedStorage to strictly declare your Routes.

```lua title="shared/routes.luau"
local YetAnotherNet = require("@shared/routes")

local Route = YetAnotherNet.Route
type Route<U...> = YetAnotherNet.Route<U...>;

local defaultConfiguration = {
  Channel = "Reliable",
  Event = "default",
}

-- Payload for replicating Entities
type EntityPayload = {
    [string]: { -- EntityId
        [string]: { -- Component name
            data: ComponentInstance<T>
        }
    }
}

-- Replicate Matter Components
local MatterReplication: Route<EntityPayload> = Route.new(defaultConfiguration)

-- Signal that the Player has loaded
local PlayerLoaded: Route<boolean> = Route.new(defaultConfiguration)

return {
  MatterReplication = MatterReplication,
  PlayerLoaded = PlayerLoaded,
}
```

And now in the same script where you create your Matter Loop, you can run the ``YetAnotherNet.start(Loop, { Route })``
function to schedule your Routes to run on Matter's Middleware.

```lua title="init.server.luau / init.client.luau"
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local Matter = require("@packages/Matter")
local World = Matter.World
local Loop = Matter.Loop

local YetAnotherNet = require("@packages/YetAnotherNet")
local routes = require("@shared/routes")

local world = World.new()
local loop = Loop.new(world)

-- Schedules your Routes
YetAnotherNet.start(loop, routes)

local systems = {}
for _, child in script.systems:GetChildren() do
    if child:IsA("ModuleScript") then
        table.insert(systems, require(child))
    end
end

loop:scheduleSystems(systems) -- Schedule systems after running ``YetAnotherNet.start()``

-- Begin the loop and make sure the ``Event`` key in your Routes configuration are added here
loop:begin({
    default = RunService.Heartbeat
})
```

Finally, in a Matter System we can use our ``routes.luau`` ModuleScript to access our Routes and
use them within our Systems.

```lua title="systems/exampleSystem.luau"
local routes = require("@shared/routes")
local PlayerLoaded = routes.PlayerLoaded

local function exampleSystem(world)
    -- Query through every networking call that frame on the Server
    for i, player, ...data in PlayerLoaded:query() do
        -- Do something
    end

    -- Query through every networking call that frame on the Client
    for i, _, ...data in PlayerLoaded:query() do
        -- Do something
    end

    -- Send data from the Client to the Server
    PlayerLoaded:send(...data)

    -- Send data to a Client from the Server
    PlayerLoaded:send(...data):to(Player)
end
```

<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

Being initially made for the Matter ECS, YetAnotherNet provides a simple function for scheduling your Routes to run on your Matter Loop.

Firstly, create a ``routes.ts`` ModuleScript in ReplicatedStorage to strictly declare your Routes.

```ts title="routes.ts"
import { Route, Configuration } from "@rbxts/yetanothernet";

const defaultConfiguration: Configuration = {
  Channel: "Reliable",
  Event: "default",
};

// Replicate Matter Components
const MatterReplication = new Route(defaultConfiguration);

// Signal that the Player has loaded
const PlayerLoaded: Route<[boolean]> = new Route(defaultConfiguration);

export = {
  MatterReplication: MatterReplication,
  PlayerLoaded: PlayerLoaded,
};
```

And now in the same script where you create your Matter Loop, you can run the ``Net.start(Loop, { route: Route })``
function to schedule your Routes to run on Matter's Middleware.

```ts title="main.server.ts / main.client.ts"
import { RunService } from "@rbxts/services";

import { Loop, System } from "@rbxts/matter";

import Net from "@rbxts/yetanothernet";
import routes from "shared/routes";

const loop = new Loop();

// Schedules your Routes
Net.start(loop, routes);

// Schedule systems
const systems: System<[]>[] = [];
loop.scheduleSystems(systems);

// Begin the loop and make sure the ``Event`` key in your Routes configuration are added here
loop.begin({
    default: RunService.Heartbeat
});
```

Finally, in a Matter System we can use our ``routes.ts`` ModuleScript to access our Routes and
use them within our Systems.

```ts title="systems/exampleSystem.ts"
import routes from "shared/routes";

const PlayerLoaded = routes.PlayerLoaded;

function exampleSystem(world) {
    // Query through every networking call that frame on the Server
    for (const [pos, player, bool] of PlayerLoaded.query()) {
        // Do something
    }

    // Query through every networking call that frame on the Client
    for (const [pos, _, bool] of PlayerLoaded.query()) {
        // Do something
    }

    // Send data from the Client to the Server
    PlayerLoaded.send(true);

    // Send data to a Client from the Server
    PlayerLoaded.send(true).to(Player);
}

export = {
    system: exampleSystem
}
```
